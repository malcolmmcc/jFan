# jFan

jFan is a tiny library for JavaScript designed to make it really easy to create radial menus. I wrote it quite awhile ago and tried to put it on github then but my computer refused to ssh into github.

## Sample usage

    $("#button").jFan({
      selector: "#menu .item",
      xradius:  200,
    });

I know a lot more now than I did when I wrote this, so I'm going to clean it up shortly, but I figured shipping a version I'm not so proud of would spur me on faster to clean it up.
